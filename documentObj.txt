Document basically the same as ordinary objects in javascript. 
Starting from the syntax to how to use it.
The following is part of the document object :
document {
  body,
  title,
  head,
  innerHTML,
  etc (you can search other part in Google, because document object is have a lot of properties)
}
but you don't need to declare the document again, because it's already a built in JavaScript object just like console, JSON, localStorage, and Math
Utility : To change the document structure, style, and content. 
Example : 
document.body.innerHTML = 'Hello';
It will change the entire page into 'hello' string.
More example in Google also YouTube.
